## :computer: About Me

I'm not big on static introductions but I'll try to be normal for a moment.
Industrial Automation is my professional specialization and I have an
eternal passion for learning and problem-solving. I'm always interested
in collaborative efforts with those aims. Here on GitHub, I share some
of my projects and experiments and collaborate toward common interests.

## :rocket: Projects

Here are some of my recent projects:

:sparkles: [In the Beginning][genesis]
: Decode $\pi$ from the first verse of the Bible.

Feel free to explore and contribute!

## :tools: Tools

* Linux
* Python
* JupyterLab
* Quarto
* Blockchain
* IPFS
* LLM
* Nostr
